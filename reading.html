            <h2>The Birth of Our English Learning Project</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey began with a simple goal: make learning English easier and more effective. We saw the
                struggle many learners faced with grammar, vocabulary, and writing, so we built a platform that provides
                corrected exercises, clear explanations, and step-by-step guidance.

                After months of hard work, our vision became reality—a place where learners of all levels can practice,
                improve, and gain confidence. And this is just the beginning

                        <p>
                            A society is a population of humans characterized by patterns of relationships between
                            individuals who share a distinctive culture and/or institutions. More broadly, a society is
                            an economic, social, and industrial infrastructure, in which a varied multitude of people
                            are a part of. Members of a society may be from different ethnic groups.

                        <p>
                            Antisocial (against society) is often used in colloquial speech to mean unfriendly or not
                            sociable (asocial). In scientific use, antisocial refers more specifically to a person who
                            is harmful or hostile to others, or to society in general.

                        <p>
                            A minority or subordinate group is a sociological group that does not constitute a
                            politically dominant voting majority of the total population of a given society.

                            A minority group can be defined as:

                            “A group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled
                            out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal
                            treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination.”

                        <h3>Association</h3>
                        <p>
                            A voluntary association or union (also sometimes called a voluntary organization,
                            unincorporated association, or just an association) is a group of individuals who
                            voluntarily enter into an agreement to form a body (or organization) to accomplish a purpose
                            for the good of society.

                            Examples of associations include those for the defense of human rights, minorities, the
                            disabled, etc.
